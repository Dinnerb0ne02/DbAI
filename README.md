# DbAI - Artificial Neural Network Framework with Transformer Agent
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Dinnerb0ne02/DbAI/blob/main/LICENSE)


## Project Overview  
DbAI is an artificial neural network (ANN) framework built on the **Transformer agent architecture**, designed to provide flexible and efficient tools for constructing deep learning models. It supports natural language processing (NLP), sequence modeling, and other scenarios. Through lightweight design and modular components, developers can quickly build customized Transformer models adapted to different dataset scales and task requirements.


## Key Features  
- **Core Architecture**: Based on the Transformer Encoder/Decoder structure, supporting key components such as multi-head attention mechanisms and positional encoding.  
- **Modular Design**: Split into layer components (e.g., attention layers, feed-forward neural network layers) for easy combination and extension.  
- **Agent Mechanism**: Integrates configurable agent modules to support dynamic adjustment of model behavior (e.g., inference strategies, parameter update logic).  
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with the PyTorch ecosystem and seamlessly integrates with mainstream deep learning toolchains (e.g., TorchScript, Datasets).
